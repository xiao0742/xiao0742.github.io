Hi, I’m Yunhao.

I’ve never been good at labeling myself,  
but if I had to sketch a rough outline, it might look like this:  
I find peace in reading physical books on rainy afternoons,  
and clarity in late-night walks with a podcast in my ears.  
I believe slowness takes more courage than speed,  
and silence often speaks louder than noise.  
I stay curious about the world—and gentle toward life.

This space holds small things that matter:  
a sunset stumbled upon during travel,  
a marginal note scribbled while rereading *Dream of the Red Chamber*,  
or yet another humble attempt to answer an old question:  
*How do we live without wasting time?*

> “He simply wishes not to waste his days.”  
That line sits in the blog’s description—  
and remains my quietest, truest aspiration.

### Sharing & Conversations

From time to time, I’ve been invited to share reflections in talks, panels, or dialogues, including:

- *Living with Rhythm in an Age of Uncertainty* · Youth Forum · 2023  
- *Can “Slow Living” Exist in the Digital Era?* · Urban Culture Salon · 2022  
- *Returning from Screen to Page: The Revival of Reading* · Independent Bookstore Talk · 2021  
- *The Value of “Useless” Things* · Podcast Conversation · 2020  

These aren’t performances—they’re honest exchanges  
about life, choice, and how we might coexist with our times.

### When Words Were Noticed

Some of my thoughts have gently found their way into publications and features:

- *Yunhao Zeng: The Philosophy of “Not Wasting Time”* · *One Way Street (Dan Du)* · 2023  
- Selected as one of “30 Thinkers on Everyday Life” · Lifestyle Platform · 2022  
- *Being a “Slow Walker” in a Fast World* · *Lens Visual Journal* · 2021  
- *Why Do We Still Need Private Writing?* · Zhihu’s “The Life I Long For” Series · 2020  

I’m grateful for this quiet attention—  
it reminds me that those who live earnestly  
are never truly invisible.
